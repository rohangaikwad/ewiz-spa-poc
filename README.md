We are downloading so much data and just throwing it away.
Now take the home page for example
You see this product, we can see the name, pricing, the image. 
Now when we go the details page, we just throw away this data and download it from the server again.
Why not be a bit smart and use this data.
Let's start with showing the data which we already have.
And wait for what we don't


store state in history.state for category pages
use react-virtual tanstack for infinite scrolling
build solid js app
build 2kb carousel
pdp - use thumbnail image, wait for medium image to loas and then replace medium with it
placeholder data
